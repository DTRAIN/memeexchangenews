Here's a list of our current development work and priorities.\n\n * Fixing remaining crashes\n* Fixing issue where homepage sometimes doesn't refresh right away\n* Reduce server costs by optimizing leaderboards\n* Improve game balance and add more risk (most posts will still remain neutral or go up atm)\n* Designing and implementing some kind of shorter term leaderboards (daily/weekly rankings on various metrics)\n\nThanks for all of your support and kind words!"
