Here's a list of our current development work and priorities.\n\n* Fixing remaining crashes\n* Fixing issue where homepage sometimes doesn't refresh right away\n* Reduce server costs by optimizing leaderboards performance and user experience (navigating 10k+ leaderboard entries can be difficult)\n* Improve game balance and add more risk (most posts will still remain neutral or go up atm)\n* Designing and implementing some kind of shorter term leaderboards (daily/weekly rankings on various metrics)\n\nThanks for all of your support and kind words!"

We introduced a minor bug in 1.2.5 that would compound over time and cause heavy performance losses, this issue should be completely fixed in patch 1.2.7.\nWe've also added a new meme filtering menu on the home page as well as some small UI improvements across the board. Try it out and make sure you report any bugs you find to us.\n\nCurrent development work and priorities.\n\n* Fixing remaining crashes\n* Fixing issue where homepage sometimes doesn't refresh right away\n* Improve game balance and add more risk (most posts will still remain neutral or go up atm)\n* Designing and implementing some kind of shorter term leaderboards (daily/weekly rankings on various metrics)\n\nThanks for all of your support and kind words!"
